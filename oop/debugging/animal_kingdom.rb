# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# Cause of Error: 
# When SongBird#initialize is called, the `super` keyword automatically forwards 
# all arguments received by the calling method to the superclass method (ie. 
# Animal#initialize receives 3 arguments, but it only expects 2.)

# How to Fix:
# We can explicitly specify which arguments we want to send to the superclass method
# (eg. super(diet, superpower))

# Further Exploration
#   Is FlightlessBird#initialize necessary? Why or why not?
# A: FlightlessBird#initialize is unnecessary, as the only thing it does is 
#   call the superclass #initialize method (Animal#initialize). As such, we can
#   safely remove it, and FlightlessBird instances will still invoke Animal#initialize
#   during instantiation via method inheritance.
