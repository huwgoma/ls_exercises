# Employee Management
# We have written some code for a simple employee management system. Each employee
#   must have a unique serial number. However, when testing our program, an 
#   exception is raised. Fix the code so that the program works as expected without
#   error.

# class EmployeeManagementSystem
#   attr_reader :employer

#   def initialize(employer)
#     @employer = employer
#     @employees = []
#   end

#   def add(employee)
#     if exists?(employee)
#       puts "Employee serial number is already in the system."
#     else
#       employees.push(employee)
#       puts "Employee added."
#     end
#   end

#   alias_method :<<, :add

#   def remove(employee)
#     if !exists?(employee)
#       puts "Employee serial number is not in the system."
#     else
#       employees.delete(employee)
#       puts "Employee deleted."
#     end
#   end

#   def exists?(employee)
#     employees.any? { |e| e == employee }
#   end

#   def display_all_employees
#     puts "#{employer} Employees: "

#     employees.each do |employee|
#       puts ""
#       puts employee.to_s
#     end
#   end

#   private

#   attr_accessor :employees
# end

# class Employee
#   attr_reader :name

#   def initialize(name, serial_number)
#     @name = name
#     @serial_number = serial_number
#   end

#   def ==(other)
#     serial_number == other.serial_number
#   end

#   def to_s
#     "Name: #{name}\n" +
#     "Serial No: #{abbreviated_serial_number}"
#   end

#   private

#   attr_reader :serial_number

#   def abbreviated_serial_number
#     serial_number[-4..-1]
#   end
# end

# # Example

# miller_contracting = EmployeeManagementSystem.new('Miller Contracting')

# becca = Employee.new('Becca', '232-4437-1932')
# raul = Employee.new('Raul', '399-1007-4242')
# natasha = Employee.new('Natasha', '399-1007-4242')

# miller_contracting << becca     # => Employee added.
# miller_contracting << raul      # => Employee added.
# miller_contracting << raul      # => Employee serial number is already in the system.
# miller_contracting << natasha   # => Employee serial number is already in the system.
# miller_contracting.remove(raul) # => Employee deleted.
# miller_contracting.add(natasha) # => Employee added.

# miller_contracting.display_all_employees

# Source of Error: 
# The `Employee#==` method relies on comparing the calling object's `@serial_number`
#   with the serial number of a given 'other' employee object; however, the 
#   getter method for `@serial_number` is marked as private, meaning it can only 
#   be called implicitly on the calling object.

# To Fix: 
# We can mark `attr_reader :serial_number` as `protected` instead of `private`. 
#   This will still prevent access to the method from outside of the class, but it
#   will allow the method to be called on other instances of the same class.
# eg:

class EmployeeManagementSystem
  attr_reader :employer

  def initialize(employer)
    @employer = employer
    @employees = []
  end

  def add(employee)
    if exists?(employee)

    else
      employees.push(employee)
      puts "Employee added."

  def remove(employee)
    if !exists?(employee)
      puts "Employee serial number is not in the system."
    else
      employees.delete(employee)
      puts "Employee deleted."
