#1 
  DCL (Data Control Language) - used to define the permission levels for users
  accessing a database.
  eg. GRANT, REVOKE, etc.

  DDL (Data Definition Language) - used to define the schema (structure) of a 
  database and its tables.
  eg. CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.

  DML (Data Manipulation Language) - used to access and manipulate the data
  (contents) of a database.
  eg. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

#2
  SELECT column_name FROM my_table;
  - This statement uses the DML component of SQL; it is concerned with retrieving
  the contents (rather than the structure) of the database. 

#3 
  CREATE TABLE things (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    item text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    material text NOT NULL
  );
  - This statement uses the DDL component of SQL; it is concerned with altering the
  structure of the database by creating a new table.

#4 
  ALTER TABLE things
  DROP CONSTRAINT things_item_key;
  - This statement uses the DDL component of SQL; it is concerned with altering
  the database's structure by altering the behavior of an existing table.

#5
  INSERT INTO things VALUES (3, 'Scissors', 'Metal');
  - This statement uses the DML component of SQL; it is concerned with inserting
  new data into a database table, and does not affect the database's structure.

#6 
  UPDATE things
  SET material = 'plastic'
  WHERE item = 'Cup';
  - This statement uses the DML component of SQL; it is concerned with updating
  one or more existing rows of data in the things table, and does not affect the
  structure or behavior of the table itself.

#7
  \d things
  - This statement is not technically part of SQL, as it is a psql meta-command.

#8
  DELETE FROM things WHERE item = 'Cup';
  - This statement uses the DML component of SQL - it is concerned with deleting 
  one or more existing rows of data in the things table, and does not affect the
  structure or behavior of the table itself.

#9 
  DROP DATABASE xyzzy;
  - This statement uses the DDL component of SQL. While the database's data is
  also deleted, the purpose of the statement is to delete the database itself; the
  data being deleted is a side-effect of its hosting database being deleted.

#10
  CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;
  - This statement uses the DDL component of SQL. Sequences are generally used to
  define auto-incrementing identifier columns when creating a table, which result
  in the table's behavior being altered, as opposed to any specific data entry.
